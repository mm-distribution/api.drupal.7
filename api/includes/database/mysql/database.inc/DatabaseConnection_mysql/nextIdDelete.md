## Code

```php
  public function nextIdDelete() {
    // While we want to clean up the table to keep it up from occupying too
    // much storage and memory, we must keep the highest value in the table
    // because InnoDB  uses an in-memory auto-increment counter as long as the
    // server runs. When the server is stopped and restarted, InnoDB
    // reinitializes the counter for each table for the first INSERT to the
    // table based solely on values from the table so deleting all values would
    // be a problem in this case. Also, TRUNCATE resets the auto increment
    // counter.
    try {
      $max_id = $this->query('SELECT MAX(value) FROM {sequences}')->fetchField();
      // We know we are using MySQL here, no need for the slower db_delete().
      $this->query('DELETE FROM {sequences} WHERE value < :value', array(':value' => $max_id));
    }
    // During testing, this function is called from shutdown with the
    // simpletest prefix stored in $this->connection, and those tables are gone
    // by the time shutdown is called so we need to ignore the database
    // errors. There is no problem with completely ignoring errors here: if
    // these queries fail, the sequence will work just fine, just use a bit
    // more database storage and memory.
    catch (PDOException $e) {
    }
  }
