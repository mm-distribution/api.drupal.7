```

## Documentation

```text
Overridden to work around issues to MySQL not supporting transactional DDL.
```

## Code

```php
  protected function popCommittableTransactions() {
    // Commit all the committable layers.
    foreach (array_reverse($this->transactionLayers) as $name => $active) {
      // Stop once we found an active transaction.
      if ($active) {
        break;
      }

      // If there are no more layers left then we should commit.
      unset($this->transactionLayers[$name]);
      if (empty($this->transactionLayers)) {
        if (!$this->doCommit()) {
          throw new DatabaseTransactionCommitFailedException();
        }
      }
      else {
        // Attempt to release this savepoint in the standard way.
        try {
          $this->query('RELEASE SAVEPOINT ' . $name);
        }
        catch (PDOException $e) {
          // However, in MySQL (InnoDB), savepoints are automatically committed
          // when tables are altered or created (DDL transactions are not
          // supported). This can cause exceptions due to trying to release
          // savepoints which no longer exist.
          //
          // To avoid exceptions when no actual error has occurred, we silently
          // succeed for MySQL error code 1305 ("SAVEPOINT does not exist").
          if ($e->errorInfo[1] == '1305') {
            // If one SAVEPOINT was released automatically, then all were.
            // Therefore, clean the transaction stack.
            $this->transactionLayers = array();
            // We also have to explain to PDO that the transaction stack has
            // been cleaned-up.
            $this->doCommit();
          }
          else {
            throw $e;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
